# MultiSuSiE
MultiSuSiE is a multi-ancestry extension of the [Sum of Single Effect model](https://github.com/stephenslab/susieR) (Wang et al. 2020 J. R. Statist. Soc. B, Zou et al. 2022 PLoS Genet.) implemented in Python. 

This MultiSuSiE implementation follows the [susieR]((https://github.com/stephenslab/susieR)) implementation as closely as possible. We thank the SuSiER developers for their work.
